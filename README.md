# Password-Generator-Refactor-

## Description
* this assignment was to test our knowledge in Javascript and see how we can get a password generator with no working code to function properly (pun not intended). I had to use different methods and arrays in order to get the generator to genrate a password according to the prompts the user (me) put in. My trouble was validating the response from the user so the password is generated, even with the difficulties, I was able to see my issue and see how to make sure the response from user is validated. With the lessons we've learned and as well as developers on stack overflow and youtube, I really got pointed in the right direction in where to start, psudeo coding obviously being the first step.

## Usage 
The purpose of this password generator is to allow the user to generate a password in regards to the series of prompts that is given to the user. If prompts are met according to the criteria then the response will be validated and the password would be generated and displayed in the text-box.
